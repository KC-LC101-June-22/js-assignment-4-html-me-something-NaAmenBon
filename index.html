         <h2>Addis Ababa,Ethiopia</h2>
         <p> Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s sprawling capital in the highlands bordering the Great Rift Valley, is the country’s commercial and cultural hub. Its National Museum exhibits Ethiopian art, traditional crafts and prehistoric fossils, including replicas of the famous early hominid, "Lucy." The burial place of the 20th-century emperor Haile Selassie, copper-domed Holy Trinity Cathedral, is a neo-baroque architectural landmark. I stay  east part of Addis Ababa Akaki and attend school called Akaki L'esprance Adventist schooland graduate highschool</p>

         <h2>Hawasa,Ethiopia</h2>
         <p>Awasa, also called Hawassa, is a city in the Great Rift Valley of central Ethiopia. It lies at the eastern edge of large Lake Awasa, with its resident hippos. Water birds gather around a popular fish market along the lake’s shore. Nearby, the waterside Amora Gedel National Park is inhabited by monkeys. To the northwest, Senkele Swayne’s Hartebeest Sanctuary is home to these endangered African antelopes. I studied my undergradute class here and graduated in 2015 and back to Addis Ababa Ethiopia.</p>
